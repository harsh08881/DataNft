# DataNft
Name of Project
Visualisation of Data-NFTs

## Proposal in one sentence
Conceptualization of Data-NFTs for the marketplace that can help data assets to have better data-consume volume.
Description of the project and what problem is it solving
Data visualization is a key component for appreciating data assets. There are a number of ways to influence price discovery and consume-volume of valuable datasets. Data-NFTs that are due to come in the future, will influence the appreciation of data assets. Coming up with a creative iteration of Data-NFTs will drive forward more work that is due to happen in this space. We aim to do this by creating a product that can act as the Data-NFT visualization layer for the data-assets present in the marketplace.

## Grant Deliverables
1.	Concept artwork of Data-NFTs that could be on offer in the Ocean marketplace
2.	Iteration of different types of Data-NFTs based on existing standards of support in the upcoming marketplace
3.	NFTs for C2D Algorithms. Typical visualization of results and analysis of sample datasets can be put forth on the data-NFTs
4.	A mockup of a data-NFT marketplace that would explain and display the above iterations of Data-NFTs
5.	Detailed research on Data NFTs from the compilation of in-depth work done for the project


## Which category best describes your project?
Build / improve applications or integrations to Ocean

## What is the final product?
Our main deliverable will be to execute a singular marketplace entity that will act as the Data-NFT visualization layer for the data-assets present in the ocean marketplace. As explained previously, the Data-NFTs will provide quality drive in data-consume volume.
There are a number of things that can be showcased as Data-NFTs that are visible prior to the metadata of data-assets, some of which are:</br>
<br>
(i)Sample dataset visualization & Sample data-analysis. <br/>
(ii) One glance artwork that conveys what kind of data-assets that would be available.
<br>


Which one or more of the criteria will your project focus on? Why do you believe your team will do well on those criteria?
According to the “value add criteria”, the project will drive ocean usage (1), add to community activeness (2), and add value to the community/ecosystem (3). In detail, these would be possible as the following:
*	Usage of Ocean: The Data-NFT concepts will essentially be a great iteration exercise to the upcoming features in the NFT marketplace. We will closely work with project-guidance working groups and other ocean ecosystem
*	Better Design & UI/UX suggestions: Design iterations are key to understanding data-assets.The NFT wave this year has shown that market recognition in the Web3 community is already existent. This can be improved even further with our design strategy
*	Data-consume volume: The future of NFTs will be driven by utility layers that are added on-top of existing NFTs.For Data-NFTs, faster understanding of data-assets will soon lead to better data-consume volume.
*	Viability of the project: With design iterations and NFT utility layers being our key strengths, this project is completely viable.
*	Community activeness: We envision our team and project to be active with the market and business partners.
*	To add further value, we will take time in understanding and partnering with relevant Ocean ecosystem partners for specific value add collaborations.

### 3.1 Details
Details of the proposal
NFTs are essentially micro-social network layers existing in the current status quo of Web3. With our deep understanding of NFTs we can closely work with teams in the Ocean ecosystem to unlock the social layer behind data-asset teams. These can happen during the future roadmap during our cordial relationship with the Ocean ecosystem.
Our main deliverable will be to execute a singular marketplace entity that will act as the Data-NFT visualization layer for the data-assets present in the ocean marketplace. As explained previously, the Data-NFTs will provide quality drive in data-consume volume.
Potential add-ons:
*	We would be open to interact with any existing stakeholder in the ocean ecosystem for contributing to design iteration discussions.
*	Optional route will be to beta-test with existing data-assets in the TestNet of the Ocean marketplace.

### 3.2 Category: “Build / improve applications or integration to Ocean”
App will be live at: As a microsite that visualizes the NFT and is integrated to the data source of the NFTs The notion site of Dehidden will hold the add-on deliverables and documentations…

#### Is the software open-source?
Yes. Since the iterations are mostly designed at the initial stage, there will be little code implementation for the proposed deliverables. If any code is implemented, they will be open-sourced.


### 3.8 Project includes community engagement
Which channels will be used? For how long?
Development updates will be shared throughout our Twitter handle as the project progresses and we hit the major milestones as per timelines in the project roadmap below. Detailed write-ups of our approach and learnings will be shared as a blog post in our Medium blog. We will also be having a community engagement strategy to ensure there is value exchange between both dehidden and Ocean Protocol ecosystem

### 3.9 Project Deliverables - Roadmap
Any prior work completed thus far?
The microsites that the project NFTs will be hosted on are complete. These will have utility access based on the NFT type and visualizations as apt. Check out the sample microsites here: Token Gated Microsite 2, Public Access Microsite 3.

## Project roadmap
*	Iteration of different types of Data-NFTs based on existing standards of support in the upcoming marketplace. (ongoing)
*	NFTs for C2D Algorithms. Typical visualization of results and analysis of sample datasets can be put forth on the data-NFTs. (Q4 2021)
*	Different design iteration of data-NFTs and visualization(Q1 2022)
*	A mockup of data-NFT marketplace that would explain and display the above iterations of Data-NFTs (Q1 2022)
*	Detailed research on Data NFTs from the compilation of in-depth work done for the project. (Q1 2022)
*	Future project integrations (Q2 202)
